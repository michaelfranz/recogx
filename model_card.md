# Model Card

## Model Description

**Input:**

The model input is a 98x12x3 (3=RGB) Mel-frequency cepstrum (MFC) image. An MFC is a 
short-term power spectrum of an audio sample. MFC is often used to extract features
from audio. In this project we are attempting to distinguish adult male from
adult female voices.

For more information on MFC, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum

The model therefore does not work with audio directly. Insteadï¼Œ an audio sample is
converted to an MFC image using some utility code, which for convenience is included
in this project. The preprocessing code produces objects, which are already of the correct
shape for input to the model. This saves us having to resize the inputs when loading  
data.

**Output:**

The model performs a binary classification, and therefore outputs a zero or a one depending on whether the input corresponds to a female or a male voice.

## Performance

TODO
Give a summary graph or metrics of how the model performs. Remember to include how you are measuring the performance and what data you analysed it on. 

## Limitations

The model's accuracy is obviously limited. The primary aim of the project was to demonstrate understanding, as opposed to achieving high accuracy. Given that this was the author's first shot at creating a CNN for processing audio, it is highly likely that accuracy would be improved with further work. 

## Trade-offs

The main trade-off was already expressed under Limitations: The model was designed for demonstration as opposed to performance. The relative simplicity of the model comes at the expense of accuracy.
